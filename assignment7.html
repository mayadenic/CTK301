    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p> Since the beginning of time, since the first little girl ever existed, there have been dolls. But the dolls were always and forever baby dolls. The girls who played with them could only ever play at being MOTHERS. Which can be fun, at least for a while anyway... Ask your mother. This continued, until... Yes Barbie changed everything! Then she changed it all again! All of these women are Barbie, and Barbie is all of these women. She might have started out as just a lady in a bathing suit, but she became so much more.

    She has her own money, her own house, her own car, her own career. Because Barbie can be anything, women can be anything. And this has been reflected back onto the little girls of today in the Real World. Girls can grow into women who can achieve everything and anything they set their mind to. Thanks to Barbie all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved!... at least that's what the
    Barbies think. After all they're living in Barbie Land. Who am I to burst their bubble? And here is one of those Barbies now, living her best day every day. When you're playing with Barbies nobody bothers to walk them down the stairs and out the door etc... you just pick them up and put them where you want them to go -- You use your imagination!

        Midge was Barbie's pregnant friend. Oh let's not show Midge actually... she was discontinued by Mattel because a pregnant doll is just too weird. Anyway... Barbie has another BIG day ahead of her. Everybody - turn to the Barbie next
        to you, tell her how much you love her. Compliment her! Reporter Barbie, you can ask me any question you want. How come you're so amazing? No comment! No seriously, no comment. I love you guys! The Nobel Prize in Journalism goes
        to “BARBIE!” I worked very hard, so... I deserve it! The Nobel Prize in Literature goes to “BARBIE!” You’re the voice of a generation. I know. Only Barbies are Barbies, and we would argue that corporations have no “free speech” rights to begin with, so any claim on their part to be exercising a right is just their attempt to turn our democracy into a plutocracy!
