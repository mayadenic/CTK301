        This makes me emotional! And I'm expressing it. I have no difficulty holding both logic and feeling at the same time. It does not diminish my powers, it expands them. Hi Barbie! Hi Barbie! Yay space! Barbie has a great day every day.But Ken only has a great day if Barbie looks at him. Hi Barbie! Hi Ken! Hi Ken. Hi Ken! Hi Barbie! Hi Ken! Hi Barbie! Hi Ken! Hi Ken! Hi Barbie! Hi Ken! I got us both ice creams! Cool. Hi Ken! Hi Barbies! Hi Barbie! Bye Barbie! Hi Barbie! Hi Allan! There are no multiples of Allan. He's just Allan. I'm still confused about that? HI BARBIE! Hi Ken! Hey Barbie! Check me out! KEN! NO! Ken? Oh Hi Barbie... How much of that did you see? We saw the whole thing! Let's get you up on your feet. Wow you are so strong! Looks like this beach was a little
        too much beach for you, Ken. If I wasn't severely injured I'd beach you off right now, Ken.

    Oh, I'll beach-off with you any day, Ken! You're on, Ken! Let's beach-off! Anyone who wants to beach him off has to beach me off first. I will beach both of you off at the same time! You don't even know how to beach your SELF off how are you going to beach all of us off??

        Why are you getting emotional?! Come on, Kens, nobody is going to
        beach anyone off! Barbie, stay with me! Not even broken, you'll be just fine.Shredding waves is much more dangerous than people know. You're very brave, Ken.Thanks, Barbie. Because you know actually my job isn't surfer. I know. It's not even lifeguard, which is a common misconception. Very common. Because my job is actually just, you know, Beach. And what a good job you do at Beach.You should heal up in no time. Actually by the time I finished that sentence, you healed. Fantastic! Hey, Barbie - Can I come over later? Yeah, OK. I don't have anything big planned, just a giant blow-out party with all the Barbies, with planned choreography and a bespoke song. But you can stop by, sure. Cool. Hey Barbie! Check me out! This is a real rager, Barbie! THANKS BARBIE! Gosh this night is
        just perfect!
