        It's perfectly perfect! You look so beautiful Barbie! Thank you Barbie! I FEEL so beautiful! So do I! This is the best day ever! It IS the best day ever! And so is yesterday and so is tomorrow and so is the day after tomorrow and even Wednesdays and every day from now until FOREVER! Do you ever think about dying?! I don't know why I just said that? I'm just dying to DANCE! Wow. You can go now. I was thinking that maybe I could, you know, stay over tonight? Why? 'Cause we're girlfriend boyfriend. To do what? To... I'm not actually sure... But I don't want you here.

     Ok. Is it Ken? No, Ken is just a good friend. And after all, this is MY Dreamhouse. It's Barbie's Dreamhouse. Not Ken's Dreamhouse. Right? Right as always. And: It's girl's night! Come on, Barbie, slumber party! Come on! The president is here! I am. You're welcome! Every night is girl's night. Every night! Forever! Every night. Forever and ever! Goodnight! I love you too. But I can't... I gotta go. Goodnight Barbies! I'm definitely not thinking about death any more! What the-- Expired?! I'm fine! A-ok! Great cheer, Kens! Ha, ha. Ha ha ha ha ha.Ha. Come on, Barbie, let's run towards the water! Hey Barbie, are you OK? Yeah, Barbie, I just fell... Fell?! I'm so... embarrassed. Barbie doesn't get embarrassed!

        Barbie, I think my - I don't even have any context for this, but - I think my feet are - my heels are on the ground. WHAT?! I'm no longer on my tip-toes. Let me see. FLAT FEET!! Stop it, Ken. I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I know I'm Stereotypical Barbie, and therefore don't form conjectures concerning the
        causality of adjacent unfolding events, but some stuff has been happening that might be related: bad breath this morning, a cold shower, burnt waffle, falling off my roof... You're malfunctioning! What? No, I'm just, am I? I've never seen this kind of malfunction.
